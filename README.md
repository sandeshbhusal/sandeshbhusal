##### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Sandesh Bhusal

I am an aspiring systems engineer currently working @[Logpoint](https://logpoint.com). I do Rust in my free time, Go in my prototyping time and Python in my professional time. Here are some pinned projects: 

1. [Competitive Programming workshop](https://github.com/sandeshbhusal/CPWorkshop)
This repo contains the code samples for if you attended the Competitive programming workshop I was a speaker of 

2. [Blockenger](https://github.com/sandeshbhusal/blockenger)
This repo contains the code for blockenger - a blockchain-based LAN messaging application written in C++. 

3. [Iris](https://github.com/sandeshbhusal/Iris)
This repo contains the code for Iris - our project at AT hackathon that enables differently-abled people to use their computers with their eyes only! (Featuring a mouse control module, a hacky keyboard written in Tk and some basic haar-cascade based eye detection)

4. [Kampan](https://github.com/sandeshbhusal/kampan)
This repo contains the code for Kampan - an educational application that teaches kids about earthquakes and what to do in case of one. It also doubles as an information dissemination center and alerting system in case one occurs. 

I do most work in Go and Rust these days, but Python is always my choice of language to prototype new things. [Hit me up](mailto:mail.sandeshbhusal@gmail.com) if you have any exciting project for me!

> I also have an alternate account [0x0decaf]() where I do most dev work these days (and mostly fail to push). You can also find me on [https://sandeshbhusal.github.io](https://sandeshbhusal.github.io) or [https://uniform-lima.pages.dev](https://uniform-lima.pages.dev).
